# Uber---Supply-and-Demand-Analysis
Supply and demand analysis of Uber data. 

Inference 
  1) The Uber can give bonus for each trip the driver complete from the CITY to the AIRPORT in the MORNING RUSH. This will ensure that less number of trips are cancelled.
  2) Uber can pay for the gas mileage of drivers to comeback to the CITY without a ride during MORNING RUSH.
  3) The Uber can again give bonus to the drivers to complete a trip from the AIRPORT in the EVENING RUSH. This will ensure that supply increases at the AIRPORT during the EVENING      RUSH.
  4) Uber can also pay for the gas mileage of drivers to comeback to the AIRPORT without a ride during EVENING RUSH.
  5) Another way could be to increase licenses of car pooling taxies so that lesser number of cars can serve more number of passengers.
